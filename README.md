# IBM-FormValidation
A hands-on project from IBM's Introduction to Web Development Course

In this lab project, I learned to:
- Create a web form
- Access the form controls from JavaScript
- Access a textbox and check if it is blank
- Execute a set of statements based on a condition to make sure information was filled
- Displayed error messages
- Execute a function when the form is submitted

Additionally, I updated my personal code to be up to standard with ES6 by switching 'var' to 'let' as well as add my own updates to the HTML as there for the email input there was a type of 'text' instead of 'email' so I switched it for better semantics.
